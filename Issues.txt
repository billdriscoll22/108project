BUGS:

In an ordered quiz I made the questions come in the order 2,1,3 every time. -eh

Clearing quiz history isn't working right now. I think db method needs to be implemented?

When deleting a quiz I got the error:
java.sql.SQLException: Illegal operation on empty result set.
at sql.DB.getQuiz(DB.java:662)
	at servlets.RemoveQuizServlet.doPost(RemoveQuizServlet.java:47)
Quiz never gets deleted.

When you click on a quiz link from a user page (i.e. quizzes they've taken) it give a divide by zero exception.

REQUIRED:
Duplicate achievements after deleting quizzes

Change homepage admin panel to only be shown to admins

Test random questions.

Top daily quiz scores.

Recent user performances on the quiz. Statistics summary.

History Summary Page for each user.

Administration: Remove quiz button on quiz view page. Clear quiz history button.
*(Mostly done, 8/13. -eh. db.clearQuizHistory(String quizId) needs to be implemented,
and testing still needs to be done.
