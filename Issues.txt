BUGS:

In an ordered quiz I made the questions come in the order 2,1,3 every time. -eh

Clearing quiz history isn't working right now. I think db method needs to be implemented?

When deleting a quiz I got the error:
java.sql.SQLException: Illegal operation on empty result set.
at sql.DB.getQuiz(DB.java:662)
	at servlets.RemoveQuizServlet.doPost(RemoveQuizServlet.java:47)
Quiz never gets deleted.

When you click on a quiz link from a user page (i.e. quizzes they've taken) it give a divide by zero exception.

*I added a User.getProfileLink() method to do this easily, but need to go through and update all friend 
references. -eh
