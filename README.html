1. beautiful layout

Speaks for itself.

2. pictures (user, quiz)

Users can choose images for their quizzes and user profile.

3. javascript tabs on home page

JQuery or some shit. Bill, care to elaborate?

4. quiz search and user search

We added the option to search for quizzes (under the "Quizzes" tab on the home page) and for users/friends 
(under the "Friends" tab on the home page). Both searches use SQL regular expressions to return partial 
matches. The results pages provide links to the quizzes/users.

5. error checking

We added additional error-checking the keeps the site from crashing and give the user a message telling 
them how to fix their input. The quiz creation page checks to make sure that all of the necessary information
has been entered (i.e. no empty radio buttons), that the user does not try to create a multi-page quiz with
immediate grading and that the user does not create a quiz with no questions. In each case, the user is allowed
to click the submit button, but is taken back to the same page with a message exlaining what input needs to
be fixed.
